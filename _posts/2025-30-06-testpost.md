An installation which documents and bring back the magic of nature into the mundanity of everyday spaces by bridging the gap between urbanisation and the spectacle of nature through mixed reality.

Using a combination of industrial sensors, visual projection mapping, and gaming technologies, the installation simulates nearby natural settings into spaces such as shopping malls, carparks, and abandoned buildings.

While the public can immerse themselves in the dynamic showcase of local Victorian forest scapes and their inhabitants, they can also interact with them, embedding themselves deeper in these natural scenes through play.

Debuting at ACMI Audience Lab, audiences engaged playfully and collaboratively with the installation, with some working together to achieve effects in the projection, children exploring the space to its fullest, and passerby pausing to express awe.
