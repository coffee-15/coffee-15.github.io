        <p>Created in response to personal computer building cultures which typically centre on the masculine themes of technical knowledge, power, and utilitarianism, My Dream PC exists as a <em>soft</em> alternative to PC building simulators.</p>

<p>Looping lo-fi beats accompany players as they peruse a library of candy-coloured, kawaii-inspired assets for their PC creations. Designed as a pleasant invitation to anyone wanting to build by relying on simple game controls, basic progression through object customisation and placement mechanics, and no requirement for prior technical knowledge.</p>

<p>The game seeks to bridge gaps between traditional masculine hobbies and feminine design by providing an accessible play space free from financial and gendered barriers in the hopes of encouraging a more diverse community of practice in the cultural ecosystems of PC building.</p>

<p>Originally made in only two months, the digital game presents with an accompanying physical PC tower and peripheral devices decorated with objects and lighting to mirror its cosy digital counterpart. This hybrid display pays homage to influential decor games, community forums, and feminine PC building stars.</p>

<p>A demo for my Dream PC debuted at the Feminine Play exhibition as a part of Melbourne International Games Week 2024.</p>
