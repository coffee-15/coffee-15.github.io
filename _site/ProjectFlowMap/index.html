        <p>The Flow Map tool is designed to give a birdâ€™s-eye visualisation of a hyper specific ecosystem of businesses and flow types. It was custom created for the ReShaping the Plastics NZ Ecosystem project.</p>

<p>Rather than viewing static images of graphs and numbers the Flow Map tool populates and displays information through visually pleasing animation and user interfaces. Various flow types between stakeholders can be customised and filtered including materials (red), services (yellow), finances (blue), and data (green).</p>

<p>Through inputting data in dynamic and playful ways users gradually learn the system while teasing out the explicit and implicit relationships between businesses. The filtering system highlights where gaps exist and who the most influential and essential stakeholders are determined by visual and gravitational rules. Additionally, lines connecting stakeholders through flow types will vary in style depending on how regular or irregular certain interactions take place.</p>

<p>Flow Map is a tool which simplifies and makes intuitive complex stakeholder ecosystems which are typically too dense and ever-evolving to capture through regular business applications.</p>
